# Welcome to your Housr Technical Test

### Objective

Your task is to build a simple React Native calculator app.

### Brief

- Your challenge is to build out a React Native calculator app that lets users perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- For compatability purposes, we're using Expo as opposed to React Native CLI.
- Ensure that you have either an Android emulator or iOS emulator installed on your system before attempting this.
- Once you have cloned the repo, to run the app run the following commands in the CalculatorApp folder:
  - `npm install`
  - `npx expo start`

### Tasks

- Your users should be able to:
  - See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size.
  - Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
  - See the calculator fits one of the three themes in the ./design folder.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **React Native** best practices
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?
- Documentation: is the API well-documented?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
